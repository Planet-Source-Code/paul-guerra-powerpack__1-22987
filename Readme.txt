PowerPack v1.0
by Paul Guerra

PowerPack is an archive manager. An archive is a normal file, but it can contain other files inside, usually compressed. This is why archives are so popular in the Internet.
PowerPack works with UNI archives.

Note about encryption
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The encryption algorithm implemented in PowerPack is not as powerful as PGP or RSA algorithm. The main purpose of this program is compression, so encryption isn't (and won't) be one of my priorities.
If you need powerful encryption, you should get a specialized software.


This program is provided "as is" without any kind of warranty.
I am not responsible of the changes that this program could eventually make to your system.
